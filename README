# December 26th 2016
As of today I decided to manage my changes through github. 
The script is changing fast everyday and im starting to lose track to why im making these changes.
Most changes are code refactoring and code layout. Shell scripts are messy and im organizing the code as I move forward. 
As today this script has been tested with CentOS 7 . 

# December 27th 2016
Changed manage.sh to main.sh
changed the file strucutre of the way the debug logs get stored. also refacored a lot of code and renamed files to have bettter organization.

Testing on a Gentoo host. 
By Default gentoo does not support iptables because of some kernel modules not being loaded. 

Error 1: " iptables v1.4.21: can't initialize iptables table `nat': Table does not exist (do you need to insmod?)
Perhaps iptables or your kernel needs to be upgraded." 

Fix 1: Posted by acmondor https://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-1009770-start-0.html . Need to enable NAT

Symbol: IP_NF_NAT [=y] 
  │ Type  : tristate 
  │ Prompt: iptables NAT support 
  │   Location: 
  │     -> Networking support (NET [=y]) 
  │       -> Networking options            
  │         -> Network packet filtering framework (Netfilter) (NETFILTER [=y]) 
  │           -> IP: Netfilter Configuration                                                            
  │ (2)         -> IP tables support (required for filtering/masq/NAT) (IP_NF_IPTABLES [=y]) 
  │   Defined at net/ipv4/netfilter/Kconfig:219                                                                      
  │   Depends on: NET [=y] && INET [=y] && NETFILTER [=y] && IP_NF_IPTABLES [=y] && NF_CONNTRACK_IPV4 [=y] 
  │   Selects: NF_NAT [=y] && NF_NAT_IPV4 [=y] && NETFILTER_XT_NAT [=y]
  enabling CONFIG_IP_NF_NAT solved everything 

  Functions that work on Gentoo

[X]  Scan Ports
[X]  User & Group Management
[X]  Search For config Files
[X]  Display CPU Info
5)  SSH Management
6)  Apache Management
7)  IP Tables Management
8)  Find Package Information
9)  Find Distro Information
[X] Tail Auth log
[X] clear all debug logs and clear all temp files
[X] Find/Stop Services 

# January 4th 2017
As of today I have basic functionality in the functions 1-4 & 7 & 10-12.
I plan to optimize the search functions once I have completed the script. 


# January 14th 2017
Version 0.3 . User Management interface is done. 

# January 19th 2017
Version 0.5 Started package management interface. Also test on redhat, everything works fine. 
Seems like the exporting of global variables for the package manager function is working correctly. However I dont really under stand why.
It seems global variables in bash are exported to the enviroment. which makes it handy to not having to keep importing different variables. 

# January 26th 2017
Version 0.7 . The splunk and splunk forwarder have been tested and confirmed working on Gentoo and Redhat.
There is a wierd permission issue when splunk gets extracted and moved to /opt , So I had to change 
the permissions of /opt/splunk & /opt/splunkforwarder to only allow the splunk user to run the services.
HOWEVER that causes a permission denied bug whenever the splunk forwarder is ran with the splunk user.
I have no idea what is causing this but it does not affect the functionality of the splunk server nor the 
splunk forwarder. At least to my knowledge

# April 12th 2017
Version 0.7.1 . Added new functionality to exsisting functions such as the backup functions and webserver functions. I finally was able to add a distro detection
file that other sub scripts will read off of, this will allow me to redirect the user to different subscripts without writting additional code. So far most of the code seems redundant, I rewrite code that should be put in classes and instantiated from. But there is not a native way of writting classes & objects in bash without doing some voodoo that I am not yet so sure of. I also added the GNU GPL V3.
